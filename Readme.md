#### What does this repo contain?

It contains the steps necessary to convert your trained PyTORCH NN to MyriadX blob format (which is used by the OAK camera). 

In particular, I go over the steps required to transform the DeepSORT implementation from ZQPei to be runned by the OAK camera.


# Important

If you are a total beginner, follow the steps detailed in each folder in order. By the time you reach the last folder, you should be able to test your OAK with your own trained and converted model!
